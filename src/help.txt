# ----- Start Help Manual ----- #

Welcome to 'Pomodoro Pal', a tool to help you stay on track with whatever it is you need to be doing.

The aim of Pomodoro sessions are to set a reasonable time-frame for work/rest balance.
Recommended work/rest time intervals are:
-   15/5 min
-   25/5 min
-   45/15 min

These intervals may be repeated as many times as needed. Typically, three to five sessions are recommended within a session.
This ensures focus is not lost due to overworking.

Navigate the main menu and sub-menus using the arrows keys and hit enter to select an option.

1: Pomodoro sessions
You must first have existing timers but you can start a session without tasks. 
Once you have set timers (created by selecting option 2 from the main menu), you may start your session by selecting this option from the main menu.
You will first select a timer then the number of sessions (iterations) of the selected work/rest timer.
Once you have completed all sessions, you may return to the menu (hit 'a') or exit the app ('b').
