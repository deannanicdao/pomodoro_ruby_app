## Software Development Plan - Your Pomodoro pal 

### Statement of Purpose and Scope

Time is of the essence. This is why it's important that we optimise our productivity so we can minimise the time spent on work and more time on play. Minimising distractions is key for keeping focussed during our bouts of productivity. This can be ahieved when unnecessary distractions are put away including other screens (tablets, mobile devices and even smart watches).  This provides an opportunity to resist browsing the web, 

To assist in achieving productivity, an interactive terminal application implementing the Pomodoro technique was developed. The Pomodoro technique created by Francesco Cirillo to encourage a productive work ethic. Time intervals dedicated to unbroken focus on work or study is typically set to 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. This is iterated three to five times or until tasks are completed. 

The target audience of this application include:

* Users who would like to achieve organised, timed sessions of work or study
* Managerial/teaching users who would like to time sessions for a group of users
* As this the time intervals can be varied, users can implement timed intervals into an activity, <em>e.g.</em> exercise/rest periods, cooking/check cooking time intervals, turn-based game timer



### Features

Features for Pomodoro Pal are described below:

* <strong>Feature 1 </strong> 'Timed Pomodoro Sessions' - Choose the time length for each work/rest time interval in a Pomodoro session

  Pomodoro Pal includes two types of time intervals (traditionally for work vs. rest) that can be customized to a set timer in minutes to suit the user's workload. Given the customizable time feature, it's applicability can extend to a variety of activities (<em>e.g.,</em> turn-based time intervals for Player 1 vs. Player 2). 

  At the end of each session, an audio notification will be triggered to notify the user. 

* <strong>Feature 2</strong> 'Audio notification' - At the end of each session, an audio notification will be triggered to notify the user

  The audio feature can be selected from a list of several audio clips. The audio feature allows the user to focus on the browser/medium of their choice while allowing the terminal app to countdown in the background. The user will only need to look at the terminal application once the alarm is triggered or when interaction with the application is necessary (<em>e.g.</em> CRUD of tasks). 

* <strong>Feature 3 </strong> 'Task Manager' - You can create, read, update and delete from a list of tasks

  The application also includes an interactive task manager in which a user can create, read, update and delete from a list of tasks. The tasks are stored in a csv file 'to_do.csv'. 

* <strong>Feature 4</strong> 'Clock' - The current time will be viewed in the terminal application alongside the countdown feature

  The current time will be viewed in the terminal application alongside the countdown feature. 

* <strong>Feature 5 </strong> 'Pomodoro Pal' - An animated buddy that grows each time you successfully tick off a task

  A Pomodoro Pal is shown during rest intervals which levels up with each successful task completed. This is to encourage the user to remain productive. 

During the Pomodoro sessions, the user has the choice to exit the terminal. 

At the end of the Pomodoro sessions, the application will congratulate the user for their dedication and provide a 'score' for the Pomodoro Pal.  This score will be based on the:

* amount of tasks completed 
* amount of Pomodoro sessions completed 
* and ????
* username input can be selected here to store the score (user/score is stored in a csv file '')

In addition, the user will be prompted with an option to continue with the same time intervals and number of sessions or add one more session.
